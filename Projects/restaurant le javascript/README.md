<h3> So , Like all the restaurants , we also serve our dishes in three parts.  </h3>

<ul>
<li ><a href="./javascript appetizers" > Javascript appetizers </a>   </li>
<li ><a href="./javascript entreé" > Javascript entreé </a>   </li>
<li ><a href= "./javascript dessert"> Javascript dessert</a>   </li>

So , what we expecting from you is to manage our restaurant and resolve these issues without changing any signature of the dishes before serving to the customers. You can find issue with the dishes and we want you to add some flavours to them and make them as usual they were in our restaurant. </h3>
